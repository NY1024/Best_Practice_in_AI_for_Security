Best_Practice_in_AI_for_Security

As we all know, the machine learning system is quite harsh on the operating environment, which will bring certain challenges to novices when they come into contact with machine learning. In this repository, I will publish a series of jupyter notebooks that apply AI technology to solve traditional security problems. Correspondingly, I will give the required python dependencies in the form of requirements.txt. All the codes in this repository are run and verified under ubuntu 20.04.
